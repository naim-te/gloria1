THE STORY SYNOPSIS            GLORIA is the story about the Death/Disappearance of a Drug Courier, GLORIA OYA who allegedly worked          for top Nigerian Government Officials and high profile Politicians and the Assassination of a renown Journal-          ist DIAMU ODION  by the same Government. A failed Berlin Journalist  BEN UZOAMAKA with Nigerian          decent is called upon to do a story years later. He’s faces so many obstacles with twists and turns. Will he be          able to write the story? And if he does will it ever get published.                                                       THE PLOT            Benjamin Uzoamaka is a washed up Berlin based journalist, long past his best years. Though he has a          Nigerian background, he was brought up in Germany and was internationally one of the most successful          and promising talents in his field. His ambition was high and in the rush of coming fame he fell. He          didn’t check his sources well enough and stumbled into a scheme, from which his career never recovered.          There was no news Print that wanted to work with him, only a small local rag read in a little town near          Berlin.          That was 10 years ago. Now, in 2015, Ben is coming to terms with his life as a local news reporter nothing          he expected. Knowing that his shot at a career is long gone, he drowns his frustration in alcohol and          cigarettes. In the midst of this dull day in day out routine, a letter from Ireland reaches Ben. It’s from          a rich English lady, who asks Ben to come to Ireland to write her memoirs for her. Ben’s journalistic          sense tells him that there’s something fishy about the whole thing. Why does that rich lady want him to          write her memoirs? However he’s too intrigued by the outlook of a real, maybe even prestigious story,          and too bored with his job at the local newspaper to turn the offer down. Ben takes the job and flies to          Dublin.           He finds his commissioner in a little cottage by the sea. The mysterious lady is also of Nigerian heritage.          It soon turns out her assumed identity is a farce; she is really Gloria Oya, the tragic protagonist of one          of Nigeria’s most mysterious drug cases, which took place decades earlier and was never solved.           Oya was captured in Nigeria in 1985 while trying to smuggle hard drugs out of the country. She suppos-          edly died only a few days later in police custody under unknown and mysterious circumstances. Just a          few weeks later there was a military overthrow in Nigeria and due to the hectic circumstances of the          time, Oya’s case was archived and subsequently disappeared.           Though in reality, Oya didn’t die. She’d had friends within the military, they’d brought her out of the          country and flown her to London. From there she’d made her way to Dublin, moved into the cottage          and ever since she’d lived there in peace, never looking back for even a second. The only thing that          reminded her of Nigeria in all that time was her gardener, a man close to his 80’s, whom she’d met right          after she arrived in Dublin. She never talked about her past to anyone, but now, the doctors detected          terminal cancer in both her lungs. She decided that she shouldn’t take her story to the grave, especially          since the men, who were in power in Nigeria in 1985, are the same men that are still in power now. They          only changed their uniforms to business suits.","2               Ben is intrigued by Oya’s story, but careful and experienced enough not to take her by her word. He          asks Oya for a night to sleep on it. Before he leaves the old lady, he wants to know why she chose him          especially. She answers that an old friend of hers called Hunter Acosta recommended him to her. Ben          met him years ago briefly on a journalistic conference, when Ben was still on his way up and Acosta had          already spent most of his life working for an insignificant little Nigerian newspaper. He and the Ameri-          can had spent the whole conference out drinking and partying.           Ben leaves for his B\&B in the little village next to Gloria’s cottage. When he comes back to the cottage          the next morning, he finds Gloria at the bottom of a staircase, her neck snapped. Ben calls the police,          and the coroner says that she had a heart attack and fell down the stairs. Ben is not convinced, even less          so, when he recognises that Gloria’s gardener seems to have dropped off the face of the earth. His jour-          nalistic sense tells him that Gloria was killed because she talked. Without hesitation Ben picks up the          trace of the Gardner, who, as Ben finds out, is already on his way back to Nigeria.             This would be Ben’s chance to turn around but he’s already too intrigued by the story and dazzled by          the outlook of fame and journalistic redemption. Ben travels to Nigeria to try to get hold of the garden-          er, to roll up Gloria’s case and to give him the breakthrough story he desperately needs.           At Lagos airport Ben gets picked up by Lola Renner, a German journalist in her early twenties, personal          assistant to Acosta. She takes Ben to Acosta’s shabby old office somewhere in the outer rim of Lagos’          centre. Ben tells Acosta what brought him to Nigeria in the first place. Acosta hesitantly agrees to          support him. He says that his old mentor and close friend Diambu Odion, one of Nigeria’s most famous          journalists, and founder of the newspaper Acosta runs now, investigated Oya’s death in the mid-eighties.           Ben finds out that Odion was assassinated in 1986, right before he was about to expose the connection          between the drug lords Gloria worked for and the military general Chimamanda Odafin Suoyo, who now          23 years later is a powerful business man, with strong ties to politics. Against Acosta’s advice Ben decides          to confront Suoyo. Together with Lola he shows up at one of the parties at the former General’s resi-          dence. While everybody is distracted by fireworks, Ben sneaks into Suoyo’s private chambers and tries to          hack into the computer to find incriminating data. Before he can complete his hack, Ben gets interrupt-          ed. He manages to get back to the party without anybody noticing his absence. He and Lola leave.            Back at the newspaper office, Ben, Acosta und Lola analyse the data Ben retrieved. Though not com-          plete, it is enough to connect Suoyo to one of Nigeria’s most infamous drug lords. However the connec-          tion to Gloria and the government is still very weak. Acosta asks Ben to be patient and not to make any          hasty decisions. Ben agrees at first but when Lola tells him she found Gloria’s gardener he can’t tame          his eagerness.           Lola’s tip leads her and Ben deep into the slums of Lagos. When they find the gardener he tries to make          a run for it through the confusing maze of the slum. Right before Ben and Lola catch him, he gets hit          by a car and dies in Ben’s hands. But before the gardener draws his final breath, he gives Ben the name          of a location in the jungle.          Ben is sure that Suoyo’s men killed the gardener and he decides not to tell anyone what the dying man          said. Instead he, Lola and Acosta go out for a drink and after a passionate night with Lola, Ben leaves          Lagos the next morning without notice to find the place the gardener was talking about.","3              Ben realises too late that the henchmen of Suoyo are already onto him. They capture and torture him          and it is only through the help of Acosta, who uses his influence in the political circles to find his friend,          that Ben manages to escape. Without a passport or any kind of identification, Acosta smuggles him out          of Nigeria and takes him to the German embassy in Cotonou, Benin. Ben has to stay in the German          embassy for several weeks. Under the agreement that his name won’t be mentioned, Acosta helps him          with the story on Suoyo. He sends Ben everything he can find and all of Odion’s research to connect the          former General to Oya and the drug lords. Brick by brick the pieces fall into their place and by the time          Ben can make his way back to Berlin, he has enough to write the story that connects Suoyo and his politi-          cian partners through the case of Gloria Oya with different drug lords.          Shortly afterwards, in his Berlin office, Ben receives a letter from Acosta’s office with Lola’s handwriting          on the envelope. Foolishly he opens it. The letter bomb kills him and destroys all evidence of the research          except for the finished story, which he already sent to his editor. Will the story get published? It the          suspects be caught and tried?           \"No evil deed can go unpunished. Any evil done by man to man will be redressed, if not now, then          certainly later, for the victory of evil over good can only be temporary.\"                                                THE CHARACTERS            BEN UZOMAKA (35) is an Afro-German with a Nigerian, brought up in Berlin, Germany.

He smokes quite a lot and drinks heavily which makes him sleep          most of the time. However he is very keen to get his career and fame back on track.

The film will adapt to African as well as European or American          viewing habits and movie standards. Especially for the African continent we schedule for the following          audience:                          •       African women 25-60                          •       African Educational group                          •       African expat population                          •       Afro American and Afro European o Students           The fact that the story is based on true events will give the film a much bigger acceptance, especially for          viewers who are interested in real facts and history. The up-to-dateness of the topic ‘press freedom’ is          constituted in times where fake news are daily undesirable events.                                                DIRECTOR’S NOTE           I’ve always been interested in issue-based movies from the onset, starting from my first feature film          “Stigma”, which is addressing the stigmatisation of people living with HIV. I don’t aim to make films          only for the purpose of entertaining. It is for me a valuable occasion to transmit strong messages and          information. The world is facing too serious issues to fathom like climate change, wars, rising populism,          and general rising hate, amongst other major contemporary challenges for humankind. This is where          cinema can play a meaningful role.          I am inspired in making Gloria, my first international feature film as a director because of Günter Wall-          raff, the most famous iconic investigative journalist in Germany and the Late Dele Giwa, one of the best          investigative Nigerian journalists. This film is based on a true event which happened in the 80s, when          the free press was still practiced in Nigeria. Alt- hough if investigative journalism was a dangerous          adventure, journalists still had the courage to find out the truth and inform the people impartially. Even          if they pay the search of truth with their lives.          Today free press doesn’t exist in some African countries, most journalists are afraid of been killed or          victimised. The truth is downgraded to a matter of interpretation and in the worst case used by people          with money and power to get their will. In the background, democratic systems can break if people          cannot appreciate the facts.","8            Gloria portrays a time in the Nigerian history where revolutionary movements like the one under Fela          Kuti, ‘the king of Afrobeat, showed courage and where on the other side oppression from military dicta-          tors was a daily event. Underlying this revolutionary atmosphere , we can feel the African effervescence          and the dynamic city life, the colours, the music and the call for a new future.           This film is a thriller, paced with strong dynamics, action and self-reflection. By following the story of          a journalist, ostracised from Germany because he deliberately faked news, we tell the story of a second          chance. This is his quest for the truth and redemption, where an ordinary person will give it all to punish          lies and betrayal and will fight for the democratic future of his native country. In that perspective          people which inspired that film are my personal heroes. As a filmmaker, my heart is fully engaged, with          an energetic cast and crew and the meaning of the greater story. My deepest motivation is to create an          eye-opening experience for audiences and to celebrate underrepresented narratives and African cinema,          through story, sound and picture. I hope people will discover a vibrant country in very special times, see          things differently and get inspired.

The first appearance of GLORIA OYA as a young          woman introduces the initial event, her arrest, as beginning of the inciting event of the story.            Sequence 1 | How everything ended: BEN, now as a grown-up journalist, comes back to Nigeria to work          for a newspaper. He failed in his profession because he in- fringed the ethical rules of journalism and          is looking for a new breakthrough.

Her story unveils the real circum-          stances about her life, her arrest, her faked death and the involved high-ranking politicians and military          brass. Before she can finish her story, she dies in a sudden accident. BEN’s instincts as an investigative          journalist are awakened and the search for the truth can start.

When he follows the trace, he          gets in contact with Lagos’ dark sides. At SUOYO’s gala BEN is getting a clear message from his host,          that he should stop his research if he likes his life. At the same time LOLA is risking her life to steel          useful information from SUOYO’s office. Also, BEN was clever enough to record his speech with SUOYO          and got his relationship to GLORIA and her disappearance on tape.

BEN suggests finding ROCHE, the gardener, who he saw a          day ago in Lagos. ACOSTA activates some contacts to find ROCHE while they are going through all the          incriminating material. The connection between drug lords and some most influential Nigerian business-          man and politicians emerges.","19                 Sequence 6 | No way out: Acosta’s contacts lead the trio to a club where they find ROCHE.

On the tape are also the voices of SUOYO’s henchmen. They           played with the devil and lost. ACOSTA realizes the life danger and sends LOLA to hide in the German           Embassy. BEN wakes up in a prison and SUOYO command his henchmen to torture him so long as he           tells what he knows and where ACOSTA and LOLA are hiding. BEN resists the torture. After days, sud-           denly he gets free and someone drives him to the middle of nowhere, where ACOSTA is waiting for him.           ACOSTA sends him to the German Embassy in Benin, gives him all the proofs of SUOYO’s culpability,           inclusive BEN’s stolen laptop which ROCHE hided in a locker, with GLORIA’s full interview. Time to           say Goodbye and ACOSTA leaves the whole story in BEN’s hands. Not to trust anyone are his last words.             Sequence 7 | Love letter I: LOLA escaped to Hamburg where she is waiting for BEN to come. She is writ-           ing a letter to the German Embassy in Benin, where BEN is and in the moment, she writes the address           on the envelope a bullet hits her head and kills her immediately. The envelope with BEN’s address is           taken by the killer.              Sequence 8 | Love letter II: BEN sits in the German Embassy and types the article about GLORIA’s life           and death into ACOSTA’s old typewriter when an embassy officer enters and hands him out his new           passport and the travel documents. He finishes the article and puts it in a brown envelope before copying           everything  into his laptop.  Back in Germany  he posts the envelope  with the  article. Back home he           prepares an email with the same article and copies of all proofs when the doorbell rings. The post- man           delivers an envelope with LOLA’s handwriting on it. He presses the sending bot- tom before he opens           the envelope. When the letter bomb destroys BEN’s office and life, the email with the truth about           GLORIA OYA is on the way to be published.              Conclusion | The power of truth: BEN’s article about GLORIA is published in uncountable newspaper           around the world, followed by articles and the investigation about LOLA’s and BEN’S assassination and           the arrest of SUOYO and other business- men and politicians in Nigeria.","20                                                     MOOD BOARD","21                                              PRODUCTION PLAN                 May 2022               June 2022              July 2022             August 2022           September 2022           Script Finishing      Start Preproduction     Start Shoot Recce      Start Shoot Africa     Start Shoot Dublin                                                   October/               November/                                            November 2022           December 2022                                           Start Shoot Germany       Post Production            Financing                                                                Casting               Apply for funding to develop project                                    Research             Contact distributors for African/European co-productions                Creating casting videos             Contact streaming services (Netflix, Amazon, etc.)                      Casting and research trips             Contact possible co-production partners             Attend pitching sessions             Calculate total cost based on the next draft of the script           Marketing                                                               Team/General Tasks                Creating marketing plan                                                  Team (Head of Departments)             Contact related NGO’s (Journalists without Borders, UN,                  Install a production manager             Amnesty International,  etc) and inflencers related to                   Contracts             investigative journalism, press freedom and  violence                    DOP             against journalists.

The          German Federal Film Board (Filmförderungsanstalt, or FFA) as well as 13 regional funding institutions          of the states provide many options. We intend to apply also for support funding at the German Federal          Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) and a collaboration with the Pan-African          Alliance of Scriptwriters and Directors (APASER) as well as sign in for the EU-ACP Culture Programme          to support coo co- operation.

Filming in diverse environments comes with potential hazards, conducting a Risk Assessment before Pro-          duction begins is crucial. Whether we are operating around heavy machinery or dangerous animals, we          will be considering every feasible risk and plan for it to ensure that the shoot runs smoothly.           4. CONTROL OF SUBSTANCE HAZARDOUS TO HEALTH (COSHH)           PRIOR to its delivery to site (and at least 24 hrs prior to use), we will supply full trade names and prod-          uct data sheets for all hazardous substances proposed for use on any TWAM site  so that a full COSHH          assessment can be made. No exceptions can be allowed           5. FIRST AID           A suitable First Aid kit will be provided each day on set.

PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT(PPE)          PPE will be worn when filming in challenging environments which will include safety shoes, hard hats,          safety glasses and high visibility vests were appropriate. PPE will also be worn by our crew when operat-          ing certain equipment. E.g lighting equipment can be very hot, so the crew will wear special gloves when          moving lighting equipment around the set.           10. INSURANCE           WE  shall indemnity  against loss, claim, liability or other expense or proceedings whatsoever arising          under any statute or at common law in respect of          - personal injury or death to any person          - loss, injury or damage to contents and property, building or structures.          - loss or damage to executed work or materials provided for that work, fixed or unfixed.

DRONE SAFETY           Before we commence any filming, we will do a recce of the location and look for anything that may pose          a hazard such as a busy airspace, protected nature reserve or no fly zone. We will cordon off the areas          we are flying the drone into so as to minimise hazards to the public. Risk Assessment and flight planning          forms will be filled out prior to commencement of filming.           12. CREW            We only hire experienced crew which is key to Health and Safety on set. We will not cut corners, mitigate          risk on set and make sure everyone goes safe and sound at the end of each day.            13. COVID           We will strictly adhere to the Covid regulations for filming according to each country that we would be          filming by making sure that everyone is tested each time cast and crew come on set. We would also ask          the cast and crew will provide vaccine certificates when travelling to countries we will be filming in.","25                                               MARKETING PLAN                                AWARENESS CAMPAIGN                                Set visits with key journalists, exhibitors and marketing partners                              Advertising campaigns of the first trailer and images                              On-set candies, in-character photography, stills from the completed project                              Teaser posters and billboard campaigns                              Meetings with opinion leaders, clubs and organizations                              Press release, press screenings in advance of release in Africa, Europe, USA                              Special contact with journalists and related organization to talk about press                              freedom (Talk show, Newspaper columns, etc.)                   MARKETING TECHNIQUES                  Offline: Posters, media ads, trailer, print media, TV, outdoor advertising, publicity events,                 press junkets, merchandising, preview screenings, premiere                 Online: Project website, blogging, social media, trailer, online posters, infographics, appli-                 cations, online advertising, competitions                  TARGET GROUPS                  Press freedom, fake news and manipulation through press and social platforms is interna-                 tionallu a hotly disputed topic. Through the streaming platforms, with Netflix leading the                 way, stories with local content and universal themes find their way in every angle of the                 world and opened a new chapter regarding the viewing habits.                 Gloria will be a blockbuster in Africa where the real events of the story will be recognized                 and where the identification with the character ensemble trying to find the truth and                 survive is given.                 Gloria will also be an internationally adopted movie, because the story guides the audience                 from a ‘western’ point of view through the film: the protagonists nativity how endangered                 is the truth and how vulnerable democratic systems.                  RELEASE                 The goal is for the film to be presented at European, American and African film festivals                 and subsequently released to cinemas. The next step is to sell Gloria to TV stations and                 streaming platforms, and finally release the film for home entertainment purpose.                   MUSIC                 We are aiming specifically for Nigerian rooted artists like Sade or Seal to contribute their                 craft to the soundtrack and push for a wider publicity on the project.","26                                               OTHER ELEMENTS                  HISTORICAL BACKGROUND               In April 1985, a 35 years old lady, Gloria Okon,              got arrested at Nigerian airport on her way to              London. The police reported that they found              over 50g heroine and cash in different curren-              cies. Days after her arrest, Gloria died without              former signs of a sickness suddenly in police              custody.               No one identified her. Her family send the corpse back, saying it is not Gloria. An investigation              which came to nothing. Rumors spread about drugs, female drug mules and high-ranking mili-              tary officers backing this business. Nigeria was led this tie by a military government and the              rumors reached till the president and the first Lady.
